      <h1>David Miguel Gray</h1>
      <p>
        I am an Associate Professor of Philosophy and an affiliate of the Institute for Intelligent Systems at the University of Memphis.
        My work sits at the intersection of language, cognition, and artificial intelligence. I focus on whether syntactic and semantic
        structures are encoded in the embedding spaces of large language models, and whether those structures play a causal role
        in generating model outputs. Current projects involve empirical methodologies such as structural probes, causal interventions,
        and artificial language training to evaluate linguistic competence and interpretability in modern LLMs.
